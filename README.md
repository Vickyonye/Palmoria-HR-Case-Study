# Palmoria-HR-Case-Study
Power BI HR Analytics case study on gender and salary analysis



## 📝 Project Overview
The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company in Nigeria, is facing scrutiny over gender imbalance and possible salary inequality. This project involves analyzing HR data to uncover insights related to gender distribution, employee ratings, compensation fairness, and regulatory compliance.

As an HR Analyst, my goal was to provide actionable insights to the CHRO and management team to promote fairness and compliance across the organization.

   - Created salary bands in $10,000 intervals
   - Visualized band distribution overall and by department

5. **Bonus Calculation**
   - Applied bonus percentages based on rating:
     - Rating 5 → 20%
     - Rating 4 → 15%
